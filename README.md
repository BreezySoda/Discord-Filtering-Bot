# Discord Filtering Bot
You can block words in messages sent by users on Discord.
If disallowed word is detected, it will be deleted immediately and the sender will be notified.

## How to use
* Insert the URL of your filter into FILTER URL HERE in main.py
In this case, the URL should be a TXT file with each line containing a message or URL you want to filter.
